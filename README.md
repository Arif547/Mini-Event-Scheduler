# 🗓️ Mini Event Scheduler with AI Categorization

A full-stack event scheduling application built with **React**, **JavaScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Node.js**, and **Express**. This app allows users to create, view, update (archive), and delete events—automatically categorizing them using simple AI-like keyword logic.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Create, view, delete, and archive events
* Auto-categorization into:

  * 🧑‍💻 Work
  * 🏠 Personal
  * 📁 Other
* Beautiful responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
* JavaScript is used on both the frontend and backend
* RESTful API endpoints
* In-memory data storage (no database needed)
* Environment variable configuration

## 🧠 AI Categorization Logic

When a new event is created, the backend analyzes the **title** and **note** to categorize it:

| Category | Keywords                                 |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Work     | `meeting`, `project`, `client`           |
| Personal | `birthday`, `family`, `anniversary`      |
| Other    | Anything not matched with the above keywords |

*Keyword matching is case-insensitive.*

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run the App Locally

### 🔧 Prerequisites

* Node.js & npm installed
* Git

---

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arif547/Mini-Event-Scheduler.git
cd mini-event-scheduler
```

---

### 2️⃣ Setup and Run the Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

**Environment Variable Setup:**

Create a `.env`  file in the `/server-side` directory:

```env
PORT=3001
```

**Start the server:**

```bash
npx nodemon index.ts
```

The backend will run on: `http://localhost:3001`

---

### 3️⃣ Setup and Run the Frontend

```bash
cd ../client-side
npm install
```

**Environment Variable Setup:**

Create a `.env.local` file in the `/client-side` directory:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**Start the frontend:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on: `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port)

## 📡 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint     | Description                        |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/events`    | Get all events (sorted by date)    |
| POST   | `/event`     | Create a new event (with category) |
| DELETE | `/event/:id` | Delete event by ID                 |
| PUT    | `/event/:id` | Toggle archived status             |

---

## 📝 Example Request Body for POST `/event`

```json
{
  "id": "event123",
  "title": "Team meeting",
  "date": "2025-07-21",
  "time": "10:00",
  "note": "Discuss project status",
  "category": "Work",       // Auto-generated by backend using keyword logic
  "archived": false,        // Default value on creation
  "createAt": "2025-07-21T08:00:00.000Z"
}
```

> ⚠️ You only need to send `title`, `date`, `time`, and `note` from the frontend. The rest is handled by the backend.
